Also, here we only report the affective measure. They also tested looking time, but it wasn't significant and there's nothing reported about it. Also, presentation was tape recording but paired with an image. There is additionally an experiment 4 where adults judged whether infants were hearing IDS vs. ADS that is not reported here."

They do report a more specific mean age in the paper. However, this is averaged across groups and there appears to be a typo in the paper. For 4.5-5mo infants, the mean age is 284.8 days and for 8.5-9mo infants, it's 131.6 days. I think the value for days is flipped (i.e., 131.6 should correspond to the 4.5-5mo olds)."
