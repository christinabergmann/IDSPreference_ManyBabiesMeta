Six groups of 12 infants were tested. One group of 12 was habiuated to female IDS and tested on female ADS; another group of 12 was habiuated to female ADS and tested on female IDS, another group of 12 was habiuated to male IDS and tested on male ADS; another group of 12 was habiuated to male ADS and tested on male IDS. These are the 48 infants reported as being included in the Dunst meta-analysis. An additional 24 infants were tested in control conditions (e.g., habituated to female or male IDS and also heard female or male IDS at test, so no IDS vs. ADS manipulation). Thus, 72 total infants were actually tested. Because the exclusion reasons for the 88 infants are reported in total, there is no information about whether excluded infants come from the experimental or control groups. Therefore, I just split the numbers in half across the two experimental groups that are included in the MA. However, this might wrongly suggest that more infants were excluded than actually were.; stimulus set changed to Werker & McLeod (1989)",
